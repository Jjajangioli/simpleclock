# simpleclock
A simple C++ clock which outputs the current time and date with various configurable settings.
Time can be adjusted according to UTC format. Any UTC value from UTC-12:00 to UTC+14:59 is acceptable.
Several Y/N questions will ask the user whether they would like to adjust the time zone, whether to use MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY format, and whether to use a 12- or 24-hour format.
This is a very small project mainly created for the purpose of testing out git and github features.
